# NOAA-Storm-Analysis
NOAA Storm Analysis in R to signify which events are most harmful with respect to population health and events that have
greatest economic consequences.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database.
This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur,
as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.
At first the data is downloaded if it is already not present and is then loaded into the workspace. Then the data is analysed for further
study. Here two questions have been answered, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health and
which types of events have the greatest economic consequences.
